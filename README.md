## Overview

### Links

- https://darkgamerxdoff.github.io/InteractiveRatingComponent/

### Built with

- Simple HTML5
- Basic CSS
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

This is the second project. I tried to turn it up a bit by also getting into js. 
Turned out to be more difficult than I expected.
But the most difficult part of this project has been submitting it. I actually finished it within a week, but somehow I never got to submitting it.
I haven't been working on frontend developement for about half a year.
I have probably lost a lot of knowledge by now.

### Continued development

I think my result is quite accurate and if I continue working hard I could get really good at it and potentially turn into profit, but I do have to have the commitment to finish and submit projects consitently.
